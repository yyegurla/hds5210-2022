# Feedback on Final

Your project poses a good set of questions to explore and you've worked through identifying some basic descriptive statistics to help answer those questions.

The report you've put together is missing some descriptive explanation of what you're trying to accomplish each step of the way.  You've used sentence fragments and headers to separate different sections of the code, but it isn't really organized into a complete report.  (-10 on Documentation / Professionalism)

Your code makes very limited use of functions that perform a particular type of transformation or analysis.  You do have several functions defined, but not because those sections of code are reused multiple times or because they help to organize a significant subset of code.  In addition, none of those functions have documentation or test cases associated with them.  (-10 on Modularity / Style)

I'm not clear from the visualizations and tables you produced how the data shows all of the answers you documented at the bottom.  I think that in your project, you're creating some confusion around what some of the data means: `YearStart` for example, seems to have been transformed at some point from a count into the actual year.  If your code and project were better documented with comments throughout, it would have been easier for me to follow and understand what you were trying to accomplish.
