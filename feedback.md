# Feedback

Refer to the homework rubric posted on Canvas (https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23670) for additional notes on the approach I take to grading weekly assignments. Basically, you'll receive 4 points for correctness of your multiple choice responses, 4 points for correctness of the programming exercises, and 2 points based on your level of programming "craft", i.e. Did you use good variable names, format code in a way that was easy to read, etc.

You will see your grades with a brief explanation in Canvas.

If I have more substantial feedback or what to show you code examples / corrections, I'll post them in a file like this back to your repository.  You'll need to make sure you do a `git pull` in your Jupyter repository to retrieve my comments before you can submit your next batch of exercises.

# Note on repository layout

Please make sure that you name your weekly folders `week##`:
* No spaces, underscores, or other punctuation between `week` and the two-digit week number
* Always use digits for the week number: 01, 02, 03, etc
* The word `week` should always be all lowercase
