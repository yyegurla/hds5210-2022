    "### 47.1: Filtering and summarizing data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this work, you'll find a data file in `/data/complications_all.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read in the data file and create a variable called `mo_hospitals` that contains a data frame from the `complications_all.csv` file, filtered down to only contain those hospitals from the state of Missouri (MO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then aggregate that data by hospital into a variable named `mo_summary`.  There are some key fields that we want to summarize:\n",
    "* We want to know the earliest date that each hospital was participating in any program\n",
    "* We want to know the latest date that each hospital stopped participating in any program\n",
    "* We want to know the total number of patients in the denominators of these programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note:\n",
    "* You will need to convert the `Start Date` and `End Date` to actual datetime fields\n",
    "* You will need to clean up and convert the `Denominator` field to just be numeric - the rule that you should use it to simply remove any records where the `Denominator` is `'Not Available'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result of this step should be a new data frame called `mo_summary` that contains one row for each hospital and contains the min start date, max end date, and total denominator.  Use the names `start_date`, `end_date`, and `number` for those columns in `mo_summary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to create your code in the form of a function, just make sure your variable names match what I've described above so the tests work."
